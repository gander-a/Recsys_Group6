General: Tasks seem to correspond to two general approaches: Collaborative filerting and NN (baseline) approach
Task 1 is needed for both approaches
Task 2, 3 (and maybe 4?) belongs to CF approach
Task 5 is NN approach

Question:
- different recommendation approaches --> Is this still necessary? Or just implement baseline and optimize?!?!

CF approach:
Need to apply filtering approach and evaluate performance


NN approach:

Ideas:
- Use without CV to use training, test, validation split ?
- Try to predict more than one type of interaction at a time -> output layer has dim 4, thus, change activation of output layer from 'relu' to 'softmax'
- Use social network data (from task 4) as additional attributes for NN model???

Parameters to vary for NN approach:
- Vary number of components in dimensionality reduction
- Type of dimensionality reduction
- Method of feature selection (Fisher Information etc)
- Type of training dataset (10000 rows by user or by tweet)
- NN model parameters

WHAT IS MEANT BY THIS? (in forum post of task 5)
x Include the embedding into the neural net, so the embedding is also learned
x Change the embedding size (maybe 32 bit for each type?)
